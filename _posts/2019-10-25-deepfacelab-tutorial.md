## Source and destination videos requirements

* High resolution (4k webm is best, lower than 1080p is not recommended)
* Faces not too far from camera and unobstructed
* Multiple angles, facial expressions
* Brightly and evenly lit
* Faces should somewhat match (beard, hat, hair, skin color, shape, glasses)
* Need at least 2 mins of good quality video, interview videos work well

## Downloading the software
> We will use DeepFaceLab to create the deepfakes. Another software, FaceSwap is also available, and will have a separate tutorial.

* [Download DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab/blob/master/doc/doc_prebuilt_windows_app.md){:target="_blank"}
    * Make sure to pick the right build for your GPU. If you don't have a GPU, use the CLSSE build
    * Here's the [direct link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17a9b9zmLdnAlItifcGSE9ixDIDAT3YxP){:target="_blank"}
    * In that folder, you will find some pre-compiled face-sets. Go ahead and download one of them to get started quickly (otherwise you will have to build your own face-set from videos / images)
* The downloaded .exe will extract and install the program to the location of your choosing. 
    * A `workspace` folder will be created. This is the folder where all the action will happen.

## Extracting faces from source video

* Name the source video `data_src` and place it in the `\workspace` folder.
    * Most formats that `ffmpeg` supports will work
* Run `2) extract images from video data_src`
    * Use PNG (better quality)
    * FPS <= 10 that gets you *at least* 2000 images (4k-6k is ideal)
* Run `4) data_src extract faces S3FD best GPU`
    * Extracted faces saved to `data_src\aligned`.
* Run `4.2.2) data_src sort by similar histogram` 
    * Groups similar detected faces together 
* Run `4.1) data_src check result` 
    * Delete faces that are not the right person, super blurry, cut off, upside down or sideways, or obstructed
* Run `4.2.other) data_src util add landmarks debug images`
    * New images with `_debug` suffix are created in  `data_src/aligned` which allow you to see the detected facial *landmarks*
    * Look for faces where landmarks are misaligned and delete the `_debug` and original images for those
    * Once youâ€™re done, delete all  `_debug` images by using the search bar to filter for `_debug`
* Run `4.2.6) data_src sort by final`
    * Choose a target image number around 90% of your total faces

## Extracting faces from destination video

You may choose to either extract from (1) the final video clip you want, or (2) one that is cut to include only the face you want to swap. If you choose 1, you may have to spend more time cleaning the extracted faces. If you choose 2 you will have to edit back the final video (and audio) after the swap.

* Name your final video `data_dst` and put it in the `\workspace` folder
* Run `3.2) extract PNG from video data_dst FULL FPS`
* Run `5) data_dst extract faces S3FD best GPU` 
* Run `5.2) data_dst sort by similar histogram`
* Run `5.1) data_dst check results` 
    * Delete all faces that are not the target face to swap, or are the target face but upside down or sideways. Every face that you leave in will be swapped in the final video.
* Run `5.1) data_dst check results debug`
    * Delete any faces that are not correctly aligned or missing alignment
    * Pay special attention to the jaw area
* Run `5) data_dst extract faces MANUAL RE-EXTRACT DELETED RESULTS DEBUG`
* Manual extraction for misaligned faces
    * For each face, move your cursor around until it aligns correctly onto the face
    * If itâ€™s not aligning, use the mouse scroll wheel / zoom to change the size of the boxes
    * When alignment is correct, hit <kbd>enter</kbd>
    * Go back and forth with <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd>. If you donâ€™t want to align a frame just skip it with <kbd>.</kbd>
    * Mouse left click will lock/unlock landmarks. You can either lock it by clicking or hitting <kbd>enter</kbd>.

## Training

Run `6) train SAEHD`

## Optional: History timelapse

Before converting, you can make a timelapse of the preview history (if you saved it during training). Do this only if you understand what `ffmpeg` is.

```

> cd \workspace\model\SAEHD_history

> ffmpeg -r 120 -f image2 -s 1280x720 -i %05d0.jpg -vcodec libx264 -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p history.mp4

```

## Convert

* Run `7) convert SAEHD`

Use the interactive converter and memorize the shortcut keys, it will speed up the process a lot.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>export_alpha_mask</td>
    <td>n</td>
    <td>Outputs transparent PNGs for use in post-production tools if you need it</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* While conversion is running, you can preview the final images `data_dst\merged` folder to make sure itâ€™s correct. If itâ€™s not, just close the convert window, delete `/merged` and start conversion again.
* Run `8) converted to mp4`
    * Bitrate of 3-8 is sufficient for most
