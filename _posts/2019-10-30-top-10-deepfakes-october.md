Halloween is almost here and we wanted to see deepfakes take a spookier turn this month. 🎃
We saw a lot of new content in the deepfake space as well as our usual suspects (Barak Obama and Donald Trump). With iperov launching the new [SAEHD model](https://pub.dfblue.com/pub/2019-10-25-deepfacelab-tutorial) for DeepFaceLab, the quality of deepfakes has improved 10x!

Let's review the top 10 of October! 👻

## 1. Will Smith if he starred in Django Unchained by Reds Only
{% include youtube.html id="8GPHUYa-mxE" %}

What a jaw-dropping fake performance by Will Smith, this fits right in our spooky vibe this month. Reds only, this was a great idea and you have executed it brilliantly.

## 2. The Joker Impersonator Turns Into The Actual Joker Himself by MagicOfBarca
{% include youtube.html id="yEvdaaiAU_w" %}

This Joker impersonation is spot on! 

## 3. Lily Collins as Audrey Hepburn by madGANs
{% include youtube.html id="vYqHJCSRhiI" %}

This scene was extremely hilarious and very well done! 💪🏻

## 4. Donald Trump as Richard Nixon by The Fakening
{% include youtube.html id="puBQ_r7ox8M" %}

The Fakening did a fantastic job of deepfaking the voice which is the next big milestone. No one can deepfake Trump’s hair though.

## 5. Justin Beanber on Between Two Ferns by OneDuality
{% include youtube.html id="x9p11pWSPDE" %}

Oh my god, it was unreal to watch our favorite Mr. Bean talk without energy but was extremely hilarious. It was almost as if this was Mr. Bean for Adults 🍃🤐

## 6. Obama Sings Spooky Scary Skeletons by Schmoyoho	
{% include youtube.html id="8Ao-eMUn-U8" %}

It’s Halloween and this is how you get in the holiday spirit!! 

## 7. Detroit Become Human by Metafake
{% include youtube.html id="o-UMBBJ_9DI" %}

Creepiest deepfake we’ve seen, spooky score 11/10!

## 8. Putin in Casino Royale by Finergot Movies
{% include youtube.html id="WWnTs2MMYs0" %}

Well isn’t Putin also winning everything in real life 💁🏻‍♀️

## 9. Obama in Black Panther by Shamook
{% include youtube.html id="ZLAj4-FKnO4" %}

Shamook making us wish this was real!!!

## 10. Dr. Elon - Dr. Evil except it's Elon Musk by Defaced Productions
{% include youtube.html id="IrRw_iKcHeQ" %}

“Could it be more accurate?” — Chandler Bing
