Halloween is almost here and we wanted to see deepfakes take a spookier turn this month. 🎃
We saw a lot of new content in the deepfake space as well as our usual suspects (Barak Obama and Donald Trump). With iperov launching the new [SAEHD model](https://pub.dfblue.com/pub/2019-10-25-deepfacelab-tutorial) for DeepFaceLab, the quality of deepfakes has improved 10x!

Let's review the top 10 of October! 👻

## 1. Will Smith if he starred in Django Unchained by Reds Only
What a jaw-dropping fake performance by Will Smith, this fits right in our spooky vibe this month. Reds only, this was a great idea and you have executed it brilliantly.

## 4. Donald Trump as Richard Nixon by The Fakening
The Fakening did a fantastic job of deepfaking the voice which is the next big milestone. No one can deepfake Trump’s hair though.
