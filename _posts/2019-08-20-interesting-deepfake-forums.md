We've come across a few deepfake forums that we'd like to highlight for their unique information and data.

|Name|Link|Notes|
|--|--|--|
|Tony is Tucker|[https://www.wxp123.me](https://www.wxp123.me)|It's in Chinese so you'll need to Google Translate it, but really solid blog posts and walkthroughs|
|DeepFakes中文网|[https://www.deepfakescn.com](https://www.deepfakescn.com)|Also in Chinese, mostly about DeepFaceLab but good turorials and deeper workflows|
|FaceSwap discord|[https://discordapp.com/invite/FC54sYg](https://discordapp.com/invite/FC54sYg)|Really good discussion and support for FaceSwap and deepfakes in general|
|Mr. Deepfakes|[https://mrdeepfakes.com/forums/](https://mrdeepfakes.com/forums/)|The forums on this porn site are a good place to start, but not ideal for obvious reasons|
|v/DeepFake|[https://voat.co/v/DeepFake](https://voat.co/v/DeepFake)|Voat aims to be a censorship-free Reddit, so naturally a good place for SFW/NSFW deepfakes discussions|

We'll continue to add more as we find other valuable resources.
