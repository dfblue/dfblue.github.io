As 2019 draws to a close, it‚Äôs worth taking a look back at the progress that has been made in the deepfake space for DFBlue. This is the year that truly put the deepfake technology on the map and showed the world the true power of A.I. and Neural Networks.

To mark the end of 2019 and the beginning of a whole new decade, DFBlue launched a 2020 teaser showcasing the use of deepfakes for adverting and the entertainment industry.

The French Consulate in New York hosted a Conference on fake news, deep fakes, foreign interference with Ambassador for Digital Affairs Henri Verdier, Chief innovation Officer at Graphika Camille Francois, Vice News reporter David Uberti and DFBlue's Co-Founder Sid Gandhi. DFBlue's participation at this high profile event showed us that the international governments are serious about the negative effects of deepfakes and fake news. It speaks of their dedication towards combating fake news and digital forgery to preserve our digital space.
