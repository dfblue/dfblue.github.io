On Sept. 5, [DeepFakeBlue](https://dfblue.com) hosted an event in New York City called “Deepfake — Fake News or Powerful tool?” which was a discussion on what's possible with Deepfake technology and how it can be used ethically.

**The questions we answered are:**

- What is possible with today's deepfake technology?
- How can we detect deepfakes?
- What are the ethical uses of deepfakes in the world of Advertising & Entertainment?
