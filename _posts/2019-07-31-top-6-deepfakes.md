Welcome to the ~~month~~, ~~year~~, decade of Keanu deepfakes!

The most favorite celebrity of the month to be deepfaked has been Keanu Reeves (thanks to data sets üòù). Throughout the whole month, we have seen really good progress with the quality and effectiveness of deepfakes. 

Let us tell you why these are the top 5 of the month!

## 1. The Shining starring Jim Carrey Deepfake by Ctrl Shift Face

> This Deepfake of Jim Carrey has been of the highest quality we have seen so far. It has worked really well in shadows and backlight scenes which is often difficult to deepfake. This is definitely topping this months list!

## 2. Keanu Reeves in Scarface by Derpfakes

> We were impressed by how well the deepfake worked with objects in front of the face. Many times the neural networks are not able to detect the face properly and mess up the facial points if there are objects in front of the face. Seems like a bit of manual work was done to mask the obstructions. It also worked really well with swift on-screen facial actions. 

## 3. Wiz Khalifa on Sesame Street by DrFakenstein

> A clean and hilarious non-Keanu deepfake we at DeepFake<span style="color: #12C0E6">Blue</span> really liked. The addition of original content was a bonus, makes me want to re-edit Sesame Street with Wiz. ;)

## 4. Keanu Reeves as Evan Baxter by OneDuality

> Great clip selection and really good deepfaking which makes you want to see a little more.

## 5. Keanu Reeves as Forest Gump by The Fakening

> This deepfake was amazing with low to none detectable glitches. We have to admit that it was a little weird to see the child with a beard in the end. But that‚Äôs the world we live in now üôà

## 6. Keanu Reeves goes Bollywood by Eating Things

> The Bollywood version of Keanu was straight up funny so had to give it a shout out!

There are 2 major challenges with deepfakes at the moment, one being the voice-over and second is deepfaking women because of long hair and numerous looks because of make-up. We are sure with time we will be able to overcome these challenges as well.
