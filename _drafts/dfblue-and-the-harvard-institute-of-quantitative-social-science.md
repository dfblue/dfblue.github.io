DFBlue announces a partnership with Harvard University in a research study on the psychological effects of political deepfakes ahead of the upcoming 2020 U.S. elections.

Soubhik Barari, a Ph.D. Research Affiliate at the Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science is conducting an experimental study to determine how people's opinions of political candidates are affected by viewing deepfake videos of them saying things they actually haven't said.

These deepfake videos are produced by DFBlue for the purposes of this study and are nearly indistinguishable as fake videos.

Using computer vision and AI techniques, DFBlue creates deepfake videos by training a computer to "learn" how to transform the face of an actor to the face of a politician such as Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. This computationally expensive process is carried out on GPUs running in the cloud with data sourced from multiple locations such as publicly available interviews and photographs.
