In the past few months we've gotten multiple requests like:

* How do I record my face for a deepfake?
* What's the best way to record a custom face set for a deepfake?
* What is best practice to get every angle with every possible expression?

## To address these questions we've created the first **Workflow for Custom Deepfakes**
